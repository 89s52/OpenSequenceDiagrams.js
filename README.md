OpenSequenceDiagrams.js
=======================

A tool to generate sequence diagrams from a pseudo language.

The idea comes from the great tool : [Web Sequence Diagrams](http://www.websequencediagrams.com).
My goal is to implement the [language used by Web Sequence Diagrams](http://www.websequencediagrams.com/examples.html).

This tool is design to be a plugin of [the file tree](https://github.com/garden/tree).
You can try it online [here](https://thefiletree.com/test/test.sequence?plug=sequence).
